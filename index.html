          <p>First, let me introduce <em>myself</em>. My name is  <strong>Almo</strong>, and I am a full-time front end developer with 2 years experience.
               In that time, I have worked as a front-end developer for both a Forbes 500 consulting firm and a small company.</p>

          <p>This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me.
               This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training
                I got from a few online courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a degree in IT project management.</p>>
